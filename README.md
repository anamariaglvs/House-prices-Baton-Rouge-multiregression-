# House-prices-Baton-Rouge-multiregression-
This project analyzes 1,080 house sales in Baton Rouge using linear regression. It estimates the effect of house size and age on price, tests individual and joint significance, explores interaction effects, and computes confidence intervals for price predictions based on age and size.

model6<-  lm(price ~ sqft + bedrooms + baths + age + owner + pool + traditional + fireplace + waterfront, data = houses)
summary(model6)

#sqft (Î²1): For each additional square foot increase, we expect, on average, an increase of Î²1 in house price, holding other variables constant.
#bedrooms (Î²2): For each additional bedroom, we expect, on average, an increase of Î²2 in house price, holding other variables constant.

model7<-lm(log(price/1000) ~ sqft + bedrooms + baths + age + I(age^2) + owner + pool + traditional + fireplace + waterfront, data = houses)

ðŸ’¡ Why is this valuable?

1. Real-World Application
Predicting house prices is essential for real estate agents, appraisers, developers, and buyers.

Helps determine fair market value and assess investment opportunities.

2. Actionable Insights
Find which features truly drive price: size? age? pool?

Know what renovations or features add the most value.

3. Improved Accuracy with Log Model
The log transformation accounts for heteroskedasticity (non-constant variance), making predictions more reliable.

More realistic modeling of multiplicative relationships.

4. Quantifies Uncertainty
Confidence intervals help buyers/sellers understand the likely price range, not just a point estimate.
